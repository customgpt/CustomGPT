# CustomGPT For Android

[![License]()

Welcome to CustomGPT! This application was simply made to allow anyone to interact with ChatGPT based API's using any ChatGPT related API endpoint. You can enter your preferred API endpoint and have conversations with any AI-powered model of your choice!

## Main Features:

- Similar to "BetterGPT" you can now use a custom API endpoint to communicate with ChatGPT.
- InApp customization allows you 
- Receive text-based responses from the AI model.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- You have proper access to an API endpoints such as ChimeraGPT, Pawam.krd, Skailar, or any API that is based off ChatGPT. 
- Android device or emulator running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or above.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install CustomGPT:

1. Find the APK file on this page.
2. Download the APK file and install it like you would any other android app. The only permissions it will request is to access to the internet for sending reqests to your designated API.
3. Run the application on your Android device or emulator and enjoy.
(Feel free to run a virus-check, there are plenty of resources you can find to analyze an APK file. This APK will not be open source for now because I am worried about the code being potentially misused!)


## Basic Usage:
Launch the App.

On the main screen, enter the custom API endpoint and key to that endpoint you want to use for communication.

Tap the "Save" button to establish a connection with the API endpoint. If successful, you will be directed to where you can start your conversation. If any API related errors arise, it will tell you the exact any error you recieved from the endpoint.

Start a conversation by entering your message in the text input field and tapping the send button.

Receive the AI model's response in the chat area.

## Once In App:

Input the necessary information to establish a connection through the placeholders (`API ENDPOINT', `API KEY`) with appropriate information. Additionally, if you want to set a optional system behavior for the bot then feel free to insert one in the "Instruction Prompt" bubble. Make sure to follow OpenAI's policies and guidelines when using any API based off them. Everything else in the app will be self explanatory.

Once you've made the necessary modifications, you can click the "SAVE" button, the app will attempt to establish a connection to the endpoint

Remember to customize the template according to the specific details of your app and API end
