Once In App:

Input the necessary information to establish a connection through the placeholders (`API ENDPOINT', `API KEY`) with appropriate information. Additionally, if you want to set a optional system behavior for the bot then feel free to insert one in the "Instruction Prompt" bubble. Make sure to follow OpenAI's policies and guidelines when using any API based off them. Everything else in the app will be self explanatory.

Once you've made the necessary modifications, you can click the "SAVE" button, the app will attempt to establish a connection to the endpoint
